# Notes
- Information must be scientifically accurate and quantitatively precise.
- Ensure synthesized information is arranged sequentially, e.g., complex (1), complex (2), etc.
- Creative adjustments must be feasible and align with contextual, chemical and experimental standards.
- Aim for comprehensive output empowering researchers to apply findings effectively.
- Exclude analysis descriptions, e.g., NMR, FT-IR data, and melting points. Watch for keywords like "Anal. Calc.", "IR (KBr pellet)," etc.
- Retain synthesis details, remove irrelevant data such as citations, chapter numbers, image and table references, or analysis information.
- If no synthesis paragraph is found, politely explain why.
